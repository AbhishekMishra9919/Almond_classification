## Almond_classification
A project on Almond classification using supervised learning techniques.

Almond detection is an interesting problem in data science because of the low degree of separability between amond species in nature. This 
means models have to outperform a lot of humans both in speed and accuracy, we need to achieve superior results to human level performance.

This repository contains two distinct approaches to do so:
1. Deep Learning.
2. Shape modelling *(this is work to be done)*

# Work done till now:
A simple python notebook that can be used as an end-to-end for training and testing a given dataset.
Just a guide, preferrable to be run on google colab.
